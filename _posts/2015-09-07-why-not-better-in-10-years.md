From 2012 it's been over 10 years, I do not get much success, I keep asking myself, what's the cause? Tons of reasons can be presented, but tonight my wife helped me to figure out the source, **I do not work hard enough**, sounds not comfortable but it's the truth, lazy is a bad word, no matter what kind of fashional hoods it has.

What should I do? everything gets start from now, when the moment seeds in its position, the picture will grow. Holi surprise yourself!
