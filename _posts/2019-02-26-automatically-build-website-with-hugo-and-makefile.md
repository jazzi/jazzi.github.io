Makefile is a file for compiling software using make, here is a [detailed description of what's makefile](https://gist.github.com/isaacs/62a2d1825d04437c6f08).

By using makefile, task automation can be easy, [Siyuan Liu's blog](https://shawnliu.me/post/using-makefile-for-task-automation/) is a great example.

Hugo is a nice static website genenrator, writing post or publish it can be easier with makefile, check [Bryan's Makefile](https://bryanstamour.com/post/how-i-build-my-site/), just type `make post` and it will ask you the post title, when you finish writing, just type `make publish`, all done.

Remember to name it as **Makefile** not ~~makefile~~, and put it in the same directory as where you would type **make**.
