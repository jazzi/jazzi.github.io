I had a baby 5 days ago, this afternoon I saw her in the NTIC kicking all the time, so happy, what surprise she would give our world! 

Last month my dear grandmother passed, and now we have a new guest, life is interesting.

Yoran, that's her name, a friend's 6 months old son picked it from 2 options, they can be child friend.
