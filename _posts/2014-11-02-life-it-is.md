What's life for? when I was a kid I kept asking questions, after graduation, this forest-like society scared me to ask again, then thirty arrived, life is about money and dream, no need/time to ask more.

I don't know how this question will play in the rest of my life, as my sweet grandmother became pretty dangerous and might go away in short time, this sucks as I have a very deep relationship with my grandma/grandpa, maybe this is the time for their reunit.

In 2 months I will have my own baby too, is that life? no stop at all, maybe what we need is not a stop but a peace.

God bless you grandma and pa, please bless my child too.
