In China, especially for business face is somewhat important, I still can remember the first time I met one customer who drove a local-brand car which is not sogood class, I thought he might not have so much power as he talked on the phone, you see a good car can be helpful for new business.

One day when I slow down and check myself to see why I am here, I found my honesty is my advantage, people trust me and I believe that, then why not be a completley honest man, not just to people also to myself. Even my company is on the beginning and small it can be great. Honesty is the solid soul. 

Sure if needed and possible, I can buy another big car, old school is not my style.
