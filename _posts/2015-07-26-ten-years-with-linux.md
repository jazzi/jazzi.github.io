Life is interesting, never ever get my passion with Linux can last for so long time. Frustration? yes, of course sometimes, but more is about peace and sweet. Freedom is limitless.

My mom bought me the first Desktop PC, I transfered to Red Hat immediately, then sure Ubuntu, at that time there are lots of vounteers help to spread the meaning of Ubuntu, I requested some LiveCD and shipped to someone who wanna take a try.

Now I am back to Linuxmint Mate, it just works great, no fashion. I have tasted ArchLinux/Gentoo/LFS/Haiku etc, they are great but just wanna to stop playing and do something.

I would recommend you LinuxMint Mate too if what you are looking for a good work station.
