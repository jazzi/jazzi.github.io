Irron Goddess, sound cool? Sara suggested this tea name for [Tieguanyin](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tieguanyin), as we all like this milk oolong very much.

It's result of tea experiment, the milk smell will disappear when the plant old than 5 yrs.

It's a great tea but still not easy to promote good tea in Euro or US, most of the importers just make order for low grade tea.
