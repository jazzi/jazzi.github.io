# Re:Subject line

Most salespeople stress over the body of their emails. You should spend more time on the subject line.

Think of cathy, short, and informative subject lines so that your email actually gets opened.

**Remember:** Only 20% to 40% of emails actually get opened but most subject lines get seen.

> Three Tactics You Can Apply To Get Your Email Viewed

> 1. **Personalize** with a point relevant to the person you are emailing, like " Hunter Sullivan suggested I contact you," or " Thanks for your blog post on x."
> 2. **Hook'em.** Share information that allows them to learn something interesting:"The future of sales emails." But *don't try to fool anybody*.
> 3. **Give a little mystery.** Be vague enough where they are curious and want to read on, "Strange question" received 20% higher open rates than average.

Keep it simple stupid.
======================

**Tweet sized emails.** Realize that you can't close the deal and make the sale on that one email.

Think in terms of the series of emails that it'll take to eastablish a relationship over emails and write them accordingly.

*The simpler and shorter the better.* Simplicity drives curiosity and it drives action. Embrace it.

Hi, hello, dear sir, greetings...
=================================

**Be different.** You'll want to come off friendly and show you are an actual human - not a machine with great grammar.

Never use "Dear Sir or Madam" or "To Whom it May Concer."

Show that you did some research. This can be in the form of referring to *a common* connection or getting an actual introduction.

If you don't have an introduction, a plain old "Hello" or "Hi [name]" will suffice.

**Personalization is the key.** Mention the person's first name. Mention their company. Mention recent press or product launches. *Show that you took time to research the person.

Don't ask them for a permission
===============================

When you send someone an email, you need to ask yourself what it is you would like them to do.

**Make it dead simple easy for them to say yes.** Want a meeting? Suggest meeting times in the email. Want a phone call? Say:"call me right now at X for details." And *always give them a reason to action.*

Mondays are the worst.
======================

Email Marketing data shows emails sent Monday mornings are less likely to be read.

**On the other hand, Tuesdays and Wednesdays are great times to send emails.**

And the tracking data shows business professionals continue to check emails throught a holiday like 4th of July thanks to mobile phones.

Try to avoid the Monday traffic hours (between 12:00-2:00pm) and schedule your emails to be sent before or after the traffic.

Clean up your digital communication.
====================================

Speaking clearly, enunciating your words, and being respectful of other people's time is important in business meetings. The same things are equally important in your digital communications.

**Make sure you are projecting the right image online.**

* Stop using colors (especially bright yellow)
* Stop using *Comic Sans*
* Stop using fancy graphics or layout, they just scream "canned." Simpler emails convert better.
* Start having a complete Email Signature linking to your online assets
* Start using lists to organize your thoughts and keep things bite sized.
* Start making it easy for them to say "Yes"
* **Bold** important sentences.

Send yourself *your* Sales Email
================================

A magical thing happens when you start reading an email in your own Inbox. You start to think more like a customer.

**Look at your Inbox and ask yourself:**

1. Would you open that email?
2. If you did open it, would you spend more than 2 seconds reading it?
3. If you spend more than 2 seconds, would you know what to do next?

**Go back to writting your email and ask yourself:**
1. Why am I sending this email?
2. Why should my prospect care?
3. Assuming I convince them to care, what do I wnat them to do next?
4. Did follow all the other actionable steps in this book?
