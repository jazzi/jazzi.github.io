I have a dream of tea business, not just about personal benefit but whole industry. 
If an US importer wanna make a 15kg order to China supplier, probably it will be rejected, imagin one day 100 importers make the same small order through mobile app, and when this 1,500kg shipment arrives US it will be delivered to each holder automaticly.
That's only phame one, everything about the quality is standarlized, even the testing and most of the communication, like farmer pick "today has sunshine" in local language, and everybody will see it in their own language.

Beside trading, the app will have a database, a smart cycer brain to instruct farmers how/when/what to plant/make tea. When a farmer follow its instructions, he will get verified and every merchants can see how is the quality easyly. Also end consumers can be helpful to make the buying decision too, not just about the quality, also about the real transparent.

So this app will collect the feedbacks and transfer to farmer/merchant directly.

It will benefit everybody involved, it's not a push like organic or fairtrade, no farmers like it.

The point is, it ends easy, make farming, trading, buying, drinking be simple and fun.
