Ok it's officially another year, we got sunshine and kidshine too and later we plan to hang out have some nice food. Technically we believe tomorrow very much no matter how pour we are now.

Family is a big support, no matter how struggle been through, it's a learning process and we have the willing. Thank you my love and little baby, I will try to learn how to have good communication.

Also gotta to improve my personality and social development skill, be a wise man not smart, reading, be alone and thinking and talk to people, that's the plan, do it.

Re the BUSINESS, I enjoy this job but absorb too much distraction, **focus** can change it. *Purity* will open more windows to love it and dig into one thing deeply.

Still export is 2016 main target, civil brand could be little brother. Trading, technically is easy - buy the right and sell right, then done. Not all big factories fits me, the pattern I found reveals:
+ Owner is the maker, so can react and make decision quickly
+ Family owned SME
+ Located in the tradtional production area, so quality and price could be more competitive

So Anxi stil needs more eyes, then Rock tea, Dan Cong, Formosa and Fuding.

Sales is the engine, marker shooting got me one but the efficiency is not so good, try some Ad? or more **persistent** email marketing? There should have a pattern for traget clients:

+ SME trading company, that can place big enough order
+ Boss is the buying decision maker
+
