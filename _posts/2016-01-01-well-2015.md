Ok it's officially another year, we got sunshine and kidshine too and later we plan to hang out have some nice food. Technically we believe tomorrow very much no matter how pour we are now.

Family is a big support, no matter how struggle been through, it's a learning process and we have the willing. Thank you my love and little baby, I will try to learn how to have good communication.

Also gotta to improve my personality and social development, be a wise man not smart, reading, be alone and thinking and talk to people, that's the plan, do it.

Re the BUSINESS, I enjoy this job but absorb too much distraction, *focus* can make it. *Purity* can open more windows to love it and dig into one thing really.
