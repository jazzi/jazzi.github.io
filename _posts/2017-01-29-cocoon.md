I have strong feeling there is a cocoon, even stronger recently, if some day I can get rid of it, not just me, the world will be HUGE different too.

Stop TV show, start reading, the plan is 30+ books, no limitation of the subject, history, economic, philosophy, computing, society all ok, this reading can streath my brain and talk to lots of interesting professionals.

No excuse, plan-focus-do*it. Dream big is nice but can't pay 90% time a day for that, reverse is the boy.

Enjoy a small promise, unlimited promise is a trap which will get you exsausted finally. Given a time/resource limited promise, then get back two smiles.

Still the final driven is not figured, for a better "I", for my little girl my fmily, for fun, for beautiful, for peace, maybe all are guests of the procedure. 

Good to have another year, cheers.
