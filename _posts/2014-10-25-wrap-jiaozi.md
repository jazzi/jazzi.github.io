I always say Jiaozi is a lazy food, this morning we started to wrap some and this really takes a while. Luckily my mom in-law did most of the work, but still it's not an easy job for rookies like me. It looks ugly but thanks GOD it tastes ok. We made almost 200 Jiaozi.

What I learned is once you put your heart into something, you will get something and you will not be sorry about the time you spent.
